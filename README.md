Semac_IcarusOverhaul_V1.44

Updated For Week 41

This Modpack changes a little of almost everything in the game with ideas taken from 
other mods and combines it all, and also includes JimK_Weapons_Mod

I recommend to use TheOrangeFloof's Floof_LevelingMod with this pack

Big shoutout and thanks to Jimk72, Critical_Fail, TheOrangeFloof, Pr0f3ss0R and BYR4M
